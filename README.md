My build of Suckless's Simple Terminal

Plumbing
--------
Inspired by and mostly similar to plumbing feature in plan9's acme and sam editors, mouse buttons for copy and paste to system clipboard.

2 Button 1 taps i.e., one finger tap selects word. 

3 Button 1 taps selects entire line.

Button 2 tap copies highlighted text.

Button 3 tap pastes text in clipboard.

The button numbers of touchpad and mouse are currently mismatched for some reason. Need to find a fix for this.
